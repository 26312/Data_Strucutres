Java


Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.

Data Object: Data Object represents an object having a data.

Data Type: Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data, the type of operations that can be performed on the corresponding type of data. 

There are two data types:
1.Built-in Data Type
2.Derived Data Type

Built-in Data Type:
Those data types for which a language has built-in support 
1.Integers
2.Boolean (true, false)
3.Floating (Decimal numbers)
4.Character and Strings

Derived Data Type:
Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types. 
These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. 
1.List
2.Array
3.Stack
4.Queue

Basic Operations which can be performed

1.Traversing
2.Searching
3.Insertion
4.Deletion
